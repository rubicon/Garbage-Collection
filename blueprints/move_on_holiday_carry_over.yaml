blueprint:
  name: Move to next day on public holiday, carry-over to next week if there are more public holidays.
  description: >-
    This automation is triggered from the `garbage_collection` integration by event `garbage_collection_loaded`,
    during the device state update. 

    It PROCESSES DATA SENT WITH THE EVENT, and then FINISHES THE UPDATE.
    DO NOT CALL THIS SERVICE MANUALLY, IT WON'T WORK (it won't have the data).

    Also, make sure the INTEGRATION IS CONFIGURED FOR `manual_update`
    (that will disable the state update by the integration and pass it to this automation).


    It loops through the calculated dates and checks for a public holiday the week, 
    before/on the calculated collection date. If found, it will move the event to the next day.
    It will keep moving if the new collection date also falls on a public holiday.
    If there are multiple holidays, It will carry it over to the next week.


    The sensors are normally updated once a day, or when Home Assistant starts.
    The update can be triggered by updating the integration configuration (just hit configure and submit).
