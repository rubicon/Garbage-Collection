# Garbage Collection

The `garbage_collection` component is a Home Assistant custom helper for scheduling/monitoring regular garbage collection. The helper can be configured for weekly schedule (including multiple collection days), bi-weekly (in even or odd weeks), monthly schedule (nth day each month), or annual (e.g. birthdays). You can also configure seasonal calendars (e.g. for bio-waste collection) by configuring the first and last month. You can also group entities, which will merge multiple schedules into one sensor.

Look to the <a href="https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection">repository</a> for examples of Lovelace configuration.

## Configuration

Go to `Settings`/`Devices & Services`/`Helpers`, click on the `+ CREATE HELPER` button, select `Garbage Collection` and configure the helper.<br />If you would like to add more than one collection schedule, click on the `+ CREATE HELPER` button again and add another `Garbage Collection` helper instance.

The configuration via `configuration.yaml` has been deprecated. If you have previously configured the integration there, it will be imported to ConfigFlow, and you should remove it.

For the configuration documentation check the <a href="https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/README.md">repository</a> file

## STATE AND ATTRIBUTES

### State

The state can be one of

| Value | Meaning                |
| :---- | ---------------------- |
| 0     | Collection is today    |
| 1     | Collection is tomorrow |
| 2     | Collection is later    |

If the `verbose_state` parameter is set, it will show the date, and remaining days. For example "Today" or "Tomorrow" or "on 2019-09-10, in 2 days"

| `days`            | Days till the next collection            |
| `last_collection` | The date and time of the last collection |

## Services

### garbage_collection.collect_garbage

If the collection is scheduled for today, mark it completed and look for the next collection.
It will set the `last_collection` attribute to the current date and time.

| Attribute   | Description                                                    |
